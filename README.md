# Genomatch
The medicinal leech may sound like a medieval pseudomedical technique, they are actually FDA-approved medical devices (as of 2004).
However, there is a lot don't known about the species. 

Motivation
----------
We are interested in eventually sequencing the entire medicinal keech's genome. This information would provide us
insight into long repeats between introns within and between genes in the genome of the medicinal leech. 
Ideally, these long reads would knit together the short contiguous sequences that have been assembled from paired-end Illumina reads; 
however, the leech's skin pigment interchelates with its DNA during sequencing.  We tried ALL SORTS of clean-up and purification,  
but even so pigment remains and tends to clog the sequencing device. 

Even though the data is quite noisy they may harbor answers and insights into:
1. What are the repeated sequences?  
2. Are there a broad range of patterns or do a handful of repeats recur all over?
3. What is the nature of the repeats in the Medicinal Leech genome that make it impossible to assemble the high quality short contigs?  

What it does
------------
This repository contains different scripts, bioinformatics tools, and pipelines (existing and new) to find and analyze repeats within the genome, to 
eventually map our longreads to our contigs. 

This project is currently in its early research stage, so come back for more updates coming soon!
